Building My Own ‘Google Translate’ for menus in Vietnamese

A study revealed specific accuracy rates for Google Translate across languages, including 94% for Spanish, 90% for Tagalog, 82.5% for Korean, 81.7% for Chinese, 77.5% for Vietnamese, 67.5% for Farsi, and 55% for Spanish. Ordering food in a Vietnamese restaurant that has its menu only in Vietnamese can be a struggle, especially if you’re not familiar with the language. To do so, I need to tap into deep learning models with my own Vietnamese-specific data sets. By training the models, I hope to automate the task of menu translations.
