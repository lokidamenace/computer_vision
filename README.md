Title: Building My Own ‘Google Translate’ for menus in Vietnamese
<br/>Purpose: Use OCR to identify the Vietnamese words in images

### Project Overview
Ordering food in a Vietnamese restaurant with its menu only in Vietnamese can be a struggle, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the language. A study revealed specific accuracy rates for Google Translate across languages, including 94% for Spanish, 90% for Tagalog, 82.5% for Korean, 81.7% for Chinese, and 77.5% for Vietnamese (with the lowest accuracy rate).

This project aims to create a highly accurate and efficient model for character recognition in menus at Vietnamese restaurants. To do so, I need to tap into pre-trained models with my dataset of Vietnamese menu images. By training the model, I hope to automate menu translations.

This project utilizes both Google Colab and Python to detect characters in input images (OCR), emphasizing image processing, analysis, and modern deep learning techniques. The ipynb files are uploaded to this repository.
